# _RESTful_ Blog APP

This is a blog app made using `Node`, `Express` and `MongoDB`, along with `Semantic UI` as a front-end framework. Templating language used is `EJS`.<br><br>
I did this in order to practice back-end. The app has `user authentication` and `authorization` for creating/altering blog posts. Each blog post also has a comments section (`user authorized`) for user interaction. The UI is clean and simple, along with the relevant `flash` messages for ease of user access.<br>

The app has been hosted on `Heroku`. Feel free to visit it at [Blog App](https://rest-blogapp.herokuapp.com/). _Criticism and feedback is welcome! :D_<br><br>
